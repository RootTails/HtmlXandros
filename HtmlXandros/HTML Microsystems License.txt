Html Microsystems Software License

You may use this software any way you like, but you should
probably give HTML Microsystems Credit, because that's
the right thing to do!

Go ahead and download the source and make something
awesome with our code! It's open source, so use
the source however you would like!

HTML Microsystems is not responsible for
any malicious use of open source
software.

There is NOTHING in the Html Microsystems hosted
web app that is not in the source code, PERIOD!
If there is, I will fire whichever one of my staff
didnt make the software completely open source :P
